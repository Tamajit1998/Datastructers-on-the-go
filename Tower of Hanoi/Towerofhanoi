    In this problem there are three sticks.
    1. Primary Stick.
    2. Temporary Stick.
    3. Destination Stick.
    Where N number of disks are stored in primary stick and they are stored in such a way
    that Largest disk resides at the very bottom. 
    One condition For that particular problem is that larger disks can not reside under smaller 
    disk.
    our goal is to send those n disks from primary to destination stick with the help of temporary 
    stick.
    
    SOLUTION: This is a recursive problem.
              At first we need to determine the base case.
                  In this case if the number of disk is one then it will directly go from primary to
                  destination.
                  but if it is not the case,
                    then at first we need to make n-1 disks shift to temporary.
                    after that the last disk should move to primary to destination.
